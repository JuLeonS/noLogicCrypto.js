Example of payment on pure JS [public]

I'm not going to explain anything; whoever needs it will figure it out. All the libraries that were needed in one way or another are in the "@js" folder. 
Also don't be stupid, include all js files from "@js" to use "pay.js" before it is declared in the code.

P.S. - In the const "Token" used empty ABI, just so that the transaction could pass, do not forget to change them. 
P.S.S - I think I will save someone a lot of time because there is not a lot of documentation that works, much less implementations.

Warning. Consider this as an example, not as an implementation of your payment, I do not guarantee the stability of my functions!
