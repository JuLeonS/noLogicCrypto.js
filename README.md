Example of payment on pure JS [public]

Warning. Consider this as an example, not as an implementation of your payment, I do not guarantee the stability of my functions!    

I'm not going to explain anything; whoever needs it will figure it out. All the libraries that were needed in one way or another are in the "@js" folder. 

Also don't be stupid, include all js files from "@js" to use "pay.js" before it is declared in the code.
